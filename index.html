        <h2>Why Make This?</h2>

        <p>
            We're looking into changing how we handle form submissions. Currently we're saving multiple times to multiple objects, by using JSON, we are able
            to have a single submission, we can then use the json to create subsequent objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            This piece is somewhat tangential in that all the saving and object creation is being done elsewhere, however we want to provide an easy way to 
            view the object structure within the json, to make viewing and understanding form submission logs easier.
        </p>

            I'm a Salesforce Developer for a Consultancy in my day job, so this is just a standard web app way, I'll be making the Salesforce component 
            available as well.

            Having built this, a couple things stand out. Flattening of arrays and objects are a fundamental point to making data sources easier to work with.
            Sorting of a flattened object is made easier by the fact that with path structure helps to understand the depth of the nesting, allowing for an 
            easier transfer of information from JS object to HTML nests.
